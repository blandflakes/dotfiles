dotfiles
========

Contains configuration files that I share across installations.

Setup is:

* xterm (configured with Xresources to use Solarized)
* Terminus font (install this independent of repo due to differences in OS)
* solarized ansi-universal dircolors. Don't forget this - causes confusion.
* vim (with solarized colorscheme)
* vim-clojure-static

Remaining configuration files/setup to deal with:

* tmux
